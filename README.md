# Calendly Vue

A simple Vue.js component to embed calendly in your web app.

## Install
``` sh
npm i calendly-vue
```

## Usage

Import and add to your components section
``` javascript
import CalendlyVue from "calendly-vue"

export default {
    components: {
        CalendlyVue
    },
    methods: {
        logEvent(evt) {
            console.log(evt)

            // Here you can handle the emitted events with custom code
            if (evt === "calendly.profile_page_viewed") {
                console.log("Calendly profile has been opened")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Use in your HTML section:
``` html
<calendly-vue url="someone-123" @event="logEvent" @event-details="logEvent" @error="logEvent"></calendly-vue>
```

url prop refers to your personal/business link of calendly, buy only the variable part, i.e having the URL https://calendly.com/someone-123, we only need the `someone-123` segment.


## Nuxt
This component does not work in SSR, to use it in Nuxt it is necessary to create a new file named `calendly.client.js` in your `plugins` folder:
``` javascript
// plugins/calendly.client.js
import Vue from "vue";
import CalendlyVue from 'calendly-vue'

Vue.use(CalendlyVue)
```

Add the plugin to your `plugins` array in `nuxt.config.js` file:
``` javascript
// nuxt.config.js
plugins: [
    '~/plugins/calendly.client.js'
]

```
